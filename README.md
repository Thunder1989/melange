# Melange: algorithms on automatic metadata inference
This library collects the state-of-the-art automatic metadata mapping algorithms for benchmarking comparison.

Currently, we include the following algorithms:
1. UVA_Active_Learning:
This is the method developed by Hong et. al [1]

2. UVA_Transfer_Learning:
This is the method developed by Hong et. al [2]

3. UCSD_Active_Learning:

4. UCSD_CRF

5. UCB_Program_Synthesis

6. CMU_ML
